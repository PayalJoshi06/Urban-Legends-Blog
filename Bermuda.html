    <h2>Mysteries</h2>
    <p>The Bermuda Triangle has been associated with a multitude of unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft over the years.</p>
    <p>Some of the most notable incidents include the disappearance of Flight 19 in 1945, where five U.S. Navy bombers vanished without a trace, as well as the vanishing of the USS Cyclops in 1918, a massive cargo ship carrying over 300 crew members.</p>
    <p>These and other mysterious disappearances have fueled speculation about supernatural phenomena and extraterrestrial activity within the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

    <h2>Theories</h2>
    <p>Various theories have been proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the Bermuda Triangle.</p>
    <p>Some scientists suggest that unusual weather patterns, such as sudden and severe storms, may contribute to the disappearances of ships and aircraft in the region.</p>
    <p>Others point to geological factors, such as methane gas eruptions from the ocean floor, which could create buoyancy issues for ships and disrupt aircraft engines.</p>
    <p>However, despite extensive research and investigations, no single theory has been able to fully account for all the incidents that have occurred within the Bermuda Triangle.</p>
