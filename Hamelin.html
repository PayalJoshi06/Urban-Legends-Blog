    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>According to the legend, in 1284, the town of Hamelin was infested with rats. A mysterious piper appeared and offered to rid the town of the rats in exchange for payment.</p>
    <p>The piper played his flute, and all the rats followed him to the Weser River, where they drowned. However, when the townspeople refused to pay the agreed amount, the piper vowed revenge.</p>
    <p>On June 26th, the piper returned and played his flute again, this time luring away all the town's children, except for one who was deaf and couldn't hear the music.</p>
